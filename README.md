# Ontology Learning Applications of Knowledge Base Construction 

Abstract:

Knowledge base construction (KBC) using AI has been one of the key goals of this highly
popular technology since its emergence, as it helps to comprehend everything, including relations,
around us. The construction of knowledge bases can summarize a piece of text in a machine-processable
and in an understandable way. This can prove to be valuable and assistive to knowledge
engineers. In this paper, we present the application of natural language processing in the construction
of knowledge bases. We demonstrate how a trained bidirectional long short-term memory or bi-
LSTM neural network model can be used to construct knowledge bases in accordance with the
exact ISO26262 definitions as defined in the GENIAL! Basic Ontology. We provide the system with
an electronic text document from the microelectronics domain, and the system attempts to create a
knowledge base from the available information in textual format. This information is then expressed
in the form of graphs when queried by the user. This method of information retrieval presents the
user with a much more technical and comprehensive understanding of an expert piece of text. This
is achieved by applying the process of named entity recognition (NER) for knowledge extraction.
This paper provides a result report of the current status of our knowledge construction process and
knowledge base content, as well as describes our challenges and experiences.
